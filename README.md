The projects in this Repository are assignments I completed as part of the Dataquest.io Data Science in Python Bootcamp. 

Traffic indicators on I-94 practices the skill of using graphs to analyse data.  The project combines the use of different graphs to identify indicators of heavy traffic on I-94 between Minneapolis and Saint Paul for westbound traffic.  

Storyteling Graphs practices using Matplotlib and the FiveThirtyEight style to create storytelling data visualizations. These graphs use pre-attentive attributes to help guide the audience's attention.
